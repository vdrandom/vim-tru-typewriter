tRUe typewriter for Russian 'jcuken'
====================================

The patch has been finally accepted into upstream.
There is no point in using this plugin since 8.1.2088.

A keymap that has Russian typewriter properly mapped.
(Unlike the one in the upstream).

Also maps C-Space (C-@ in terminal) to keymap switching. I'll probably be the
only one to use it anyways, so hardcoded.
